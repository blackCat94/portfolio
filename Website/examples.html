<!-- about the project -->
<h3> Final Year Project </h3>
<p> For my final year project I created a mobile website that used web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript to access the hardware of the phone. 
In this case the hardware that was access was the camera. 
This project spanned throughout the final year of University to planning, creating, testing and presenting it. </p>

<p>For this I used the getUserMedia API. When the user loads the app and selects camera the rear facing or front facing, 
it will first ask for permissions before accessing the camera. 
Once the user gives permission it will then access the camera and display it through the app shown in screen shots below. </p>

<p>The user can then take a photo by pressing the take a photo button which once pressed will take the photo and display the photo on the screen also. 
If you are happy with it you can then save it to the phones memory in the album. </p>

<h3> Practice information site </h3>
<!-- about the project -->
<p>This website I created was a practice one, just to keep my hand in. I created an information site about fitness to combine two interests of mine which was web development and fitness.</p>
<p> I stared by designing it out to cover all areas of keeping a healthy lifestyle and have a page for each, on each page I also have a little box to the side which contains
bullet point of the main areas covered to if the user would just want to learn quick tips. </p>
<p>To create this I used HTML and CSS and icluded hover over on the navagation bar for the text to go from black to white when the user hovers over that option.</p>

<h3> My portfolio site </h3>
<p> My final example of my work is this site we are on, my portfolio site. </p>
<p> The idea of this site was to have a one place to display all of my mini projects that I have worked on, so we have the about me section which includes my skills and then the example page
which shows examples of work that I have done. </p>
<p> For the design of this site, I wanted to make it as mobile friendly as possible from the images that alter depending on the device they are being displayed on, to having the navagation, spaced out 
at the top of the page, so mobile users can still us it easily. I also kept it quite clean and simple not too busy this was becuase it was a portfolio site and I wanted it to be more professional looking, 
but still had the gradient from lilac to white, so it wasnt boring. </p>
