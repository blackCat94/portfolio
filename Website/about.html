<p>In my first year of University I learnt how to code a website using HTML 5 and CSS3. 
This then progressed in the second year with adding in JavaScript to website to create an interactive web application.
 For my final year project I created a prototype mobile website that will be able to access the phones hardware using JavaScript.</p>
 
<p>Outside of web development I keep a personal blog on WordPress as well as enjoy going to the gym and joining in on classes for example spin class. 
I also recently took an Ice Skating course at my local Ice Rink and have been learning how to ice skate. </p>
