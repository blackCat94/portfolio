<h1 class="about-title">About me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Adele Dibble and welcome to my portfolio website.</p>

<p>I am a graduate from the University of Wolverhampton where I got a first class degree in Computer Science.
Since then I have continued my interest by creating this portfolio that you are looking at now,
as well as some other projects you will see mentioned throughout this website. </p>

<p>From my time at University I learnt a lot new skills both technical and personal,
it is where I also developed my interest in Front end development,
this is what this portfolio site will mainly focus on. </p>
